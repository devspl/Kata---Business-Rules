**Language used:** C#

**Idea description:** 
Creating an event root and defining handlers through IoC container, that will act on specified payment if their internally developed requirements are all met.

**Status:** 
Barely completed handlers, would need to expand further on with products, categories, possible multi-inheritance and even greater ability and flexibility for solution.
